Description: A collection of classes that represent
    archaeological data. This package provides a set of S4 classes that
    extend the basic matrix data type (absolute/relative frequency,
    presence/absence data, co-occurrence matrix, etc.) upon which package
    developers can build subclasses. It also provides a set of generic
    methods (mutators and coercion mechanisms) and functions (e.g.
    predicates). In addition, a few classes of general interest (e.g. that
    represent stratigraphic relationships) are implemented.
